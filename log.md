# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 2, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Objective**: Implement thumbnails, validation and other issues from accounting software

**Today's Progress**: Several of the small issues were solved. Tic tac toe working is missing the moves on time.

**Thoughts:**  I didn't manage my time properly so I could have done more.
